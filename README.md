# A List to Store Pages You Want to Read!

[Try it out.](https://adam-rice.github.io/linked_list/)

Created by [Christine Gamble](https://github.com/ccgamble) and [Adam Rice](https://github.com/adam-rice).

Two input fields.
One for the title of the bookmark.
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to.
One for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page.

* A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark.
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL).
A button to “Mark as Read”.
A button to “Remove” the bookmark.

The user should be able to input a title and URL into the appropriate fields.
When the user clicks on the button for creating the bookmark, it should be added to the bookmarks section.

* When the user clicks on the “Mark as Read” button:
A class of .read should be added to the bookmark.
If it already has the class of .read, it should be removed.
When the user clicks on the “Remove” button, the link should be removed from the page.

If the user omits the title or the URL, the application should not create the link and should instead display an error.
The application should be resposive and work equally well on desktop and mobile.
